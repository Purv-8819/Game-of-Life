# Game of Life | Personal Project

This is a full-stack implementation of Conway's **Game of Life** built using **Next.js**. The application allows users to simulate the cellular automaton on a grid, with features to start, step through, and reset the game. The back-end logic for the game is implemented using Next.js API routes, and the front end is built with React components.
